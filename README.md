The aim of this repository is to document the attempt to fill an organisation in a gitops style.

To do this this organisation is setup to cotrol all the github teams, roles and access for the main organisations repositories. This extra organisation might be unecessary but have started this way just in case of circular dependencies of a github organisation containing it's own depeendencies.
